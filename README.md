This is the UI calling the developed api - https://garvitwork.github.io/UI_explain/ (visit this site to test this code with the provided processed data and ml model.) If you want to try this UI using some other ML model and data, make sure the data has the same features (if created new or dropped some existing features) which the ML model used for training. Also, the processed data should not have the target variable. The data or the processed data which you will input in this UI should have exactly same features that the ML model (which you will input in UI) used while training.
